# Melody Mixer Demos
Meldoy Mixer is a series of short demos, each building on the last showing how to use Magenta's new machine learning library [MusicVAE.js](https://goo.gl/magenta/musicvae-js) to blend between melodies in real time in the browser, as well as visualize the melodies with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and play back the melodies using [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/).

For a step by step guide on how build Melody Mixer check out the [blogpost](https://goo.gl/sW5QrS ).
